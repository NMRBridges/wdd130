        family here in the states.<br> I’m taking applied technology degree path through Pathways while working

<p>My main hobbies are reading and gaming. <br> I play mostly League, Warzone, Fortnite now that building is gone, and a ton of Elden Ring.<br>

<h2>Reasons for taking this class</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed web design in High school when I took the class.<br>One of my close friends also
    regularly freelances designing websites<br> and I’ve had the opportunity to watch and occasionally assist 
    and really loved the process and the opportunities it opened up for him.<br> Really looking forward to 
    getting to that place in my coding eventually and working with all of you this semester.
