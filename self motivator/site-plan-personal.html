      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>People like encouragement and recognition when setting, working towards, and completing a goal; weather it’s a fitness or financial, or familial, or any other number of things we strive for. I would like to make a website where we can come together and receive that encouragement and recognition as we set visible goals. A place where family and friends and possibly strangers can help each other to reach new heights and help provide the motivation that we can sometimes lack on our own.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience are young adults who now that they are away from home are I need of a way to remind and encourage them to set and achieve personal and professional goals in order to help them grow into driven and successful members of society. A well as provide anonymity to help offset the embarrassment or anxiety that can come when we aren’t on track or miss a goal entirely.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Overview -main
        Visitors to this site will be engaging in personal projects and using the resources available to stay accountable whether it's personal goal tracking or engaging with public feedback in an effort to stay on task. People will come here  in an effort to facilitate self improvement or to maintain personal accountability. We will provide an easy and convenient platform for those people to achieve the personal and professional goals they need for that self improvement.
        
        Expectations
        Those who visit and decide to engage will be expected to decide on what types of goals they wish to receive help with. And be ready to commit to  writing those goals down and using our resources to develop a plan of attack and accountability. Example John Doe decided to set a goal to lose 30lbs and set a plan to diet and exercise to get to his goal. He will then be prompted to set a schedule for exercise that he would track along with his diet. He would be prompted on his schedule and would have the option to receive feedback or encouragement publicly if he started to struggle with hitting his targets, or he could keep it private and opt into more aggressive reminders to also help hit his target goals.

      <h3>[Opportunities to help]</h3>
      <p>
                Becoming ambassadors though example - main
        We hope that people will visit the site in order to take advantage of the public forums as well as the convenience of and ease of access we would provide. We believe that by engaging publicly for support and also engaging in helping those in need of support people can start to build the habits necessary to no longer need help in achieving personal or professional goals. As they build confidence and help both themselves and others they will become ambassadors of change and progress will be set to inspire healthy habits in their own and the lives of those they help, and those around them in their personal lives.
        
        End game
        We hope that by offering this service we can better families, communities, friendships, professional, and individual relationships and lives. As we help build more confident and successful members of society. And that by doing that we can not only help people pull themselves up ito the people they want to be but also help them become ambassadors to their communities, families, or professions.

      <h3>[Tools]</h3>
      <p>
        Convenience and opportunity - main
        Those who don't want to engage in the public forums will be missing out on opportunities, however we recognize not everyone will want or appreciate feedback or encouragement and as such we also plan on having tools available to assist those people push towards the results they want, with the hope but not expectation that they would eventually want to help in the community we hope to develop. However even if they dont we hope that they will still develop into ambassadors in their personal lives as they gain confidence through hitting their set targets.

        Anonymity 
        Anonymity will be a key factor in all public exchanges although there will be options for those who want to forgo that anonymity if they so desire. However, that will never be pushed on those who don't want that. First and foremost we want people to feel comfortable setting goals and being open to others to receive encouragement or kudos for hitting targets. And we recognize that it is much easier and convenient to maintain anonymity when we engage in the public domain, which is the main goal of this site and community.
